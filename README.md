Blue-Neuroscience-as-a-Service-SingleCell is an open source web application.
It enables users to quickly visualize single cell model morphologies in 3D
or as a dendrogram. Using simple Web user interface, single cell simulations
can be easily configured and launched, producing voltage traces from selected
compartments.
